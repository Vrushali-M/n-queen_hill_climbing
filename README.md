# n-queen_hill_climbing
This program solves n-queen problem with 4 different types of hill climbing algorithms



The program takes input from user and creates a random configuration of n queens.
It then solves the n-queen problem by using the following algorithms.

1)Steepest Ascent hill climbing
2)Steepest Ascent with sideway moves hill climbing
3)Random Restart hill climbing
4)Random Restart with sideway moves hill climbing

After it has run completely; it calculates the average number of times that it restarted and the
average number of steps taken.
